# project 2

- We did some copy and pasting and ending creating resources with the name of "example"
- If we rename the resources from "example" to "dev" and try to reapply the changes Terraform will have to recreate the resources (read: this would cause an outage)
- Can you think of a way for us to rename the resource to "dev" without having to recreate all the resources
- Update this README.md with the instructions to solve this problem
